## Project 1: Raster Graphics Editor

- created a primitive image manipulation program using OpenCV. The goal is to become familiar with basic OpenCV data structures and manipulation, such as pixel access, ROIs, copying, visualization, etc.

- The program should be able to be compiled and executed by running the following set of commands in the program directory:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./cv_Raster_Graphic_Editor ../test.png
```
or
```bash
cmake .
make
./cv_Raster_Graphic_Editor test.png
```
